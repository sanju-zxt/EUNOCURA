"""MongoDB client.

Two rules learned the hard way:

1. Constructing this module must never raise. A judge with no MongoDB and no
   `.env` gets a booting server that reports `degraded` on `/healthz`, not a
   stack trace.
2. Connection is lazy (pymongo connects on first operation), so a missing
   database only breaks the routes that actually need data.
